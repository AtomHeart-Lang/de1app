# DE1Beta Tablet App

The `misc` submodule containes scripts and androwish / undroidwish support files.
The `psd` submodule contains the original photoshop files from which the skins and settings pages are generated. For now the access is only available on invite on the decent diaspora forum to limit the bandwidth that is hitting the LFS.

The de1beta folder should ideally be copyable directly to the tablet and run from there. Further testing might be required to test some of the so far unreleased skins.
